<p>
Pokémon GO is an augmented reality (AR) mobile game developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. It was released in July 2016 and quickly became a global phenomenon, attracting millions of players worldwide.

The game utilizes GPS and the camera of compatible devices to allow players to capture, battle, and train virtual creatures called Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the real world. Players explore their surroundings to find and catch Pokémon, visit PokéStops (real-world locations marked on the in-game map), and participate in Gym battles to compete with other players.</p>

## Gameplay Data

</style>
<p>The  `GameplayLocationHistory.tsv` file contains Pokémon GO gameplay location data recorded during player sessions. This file follows the TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format, which structures data similarly to CSV files but uses tabs to separate fields.

The dataset includes essential information such as the date and time of each reported location, along with latitude and longitude coordinates. This data provides valuable insights into player behavior, allowing analysis of movement patterns and visualization of gameplay activity across different time periods and geographical areas. Researchers and analysts can leverage this dataset to better understand player engagement, popular gaming locations, and trends in Pokémon GO gameplay.

## Gameplay Map (4 pts)
</style>
<p> Please create an interactive  `leaflet` map that displays all available coordinates within Germany, with the color indicating the time since the start of data collection. You can have a slightly different style for the map. It should be any leaflet format. The timing of data points should be visible by any means.

## Game Data TimeLine(2 pts)
</style>
<p>Please create a timeline of all observations per day to inspect the total activity. The overall gameplay seems to have some days of increased activity. Let’s see if we can connect them with event data. Pokémon GO Community Days are special monthly events organized by Niantic, the developer of Pokémon GO. During Community Days, players have the opportunity to encounter a specific Pokémon more frequently in the wild for a limited time period, typically three hours. Please add community days to the graph to see if peaks are related to the events. Adding the event data is optional!
